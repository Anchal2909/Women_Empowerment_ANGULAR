                Smile Foundation, an Indian social development organization, is
                directly benefitting over 15 lakh children and their families
                every year. We have more than 400 live welfare projects on
                education, healthcare, livelihood, and women’s empowerment in
                over 2,000 remote villages and urban slums across 25 states of
                India. The groundwork for a better life lies in education. It is
                the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. However, a
                child cannot be educated in isolation. Only an empowered family,
                especially the mother, would be willing to educate their child.
                Thus, rather than focusing on only one stage of a person's life,
                we believe in the lifecycle approach. Education empowers an
                individual to earn their livelihood and also increases one's
                awareness on a range of issues. From healthcare, to appropriate
                social behavior, to understanding one's rights – Smile
                Foundation seeks to educate, empower and cultivate better
                citizens.

                Pratham is an innovative learning organization created to
                improve the quality of education in India. Established in 1995
                to provide education to children in the slums of Mumbai, Pratham
                has grown in both scope and scale, with programs today reaching
                children and youth across the country. As one of the largest
                non-governmental organizations in the country, Pratham focuses
                on high-quality, low-cost and replicable interventions to
                address gaps in the education system. Working directly with
                children and youth as well as through large-scale collaborations
                with government systems, Pratham programs reach millions of
                lives every year. Pratham's Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL)
                approach has demonstrated proven impact on children's learning
                outcomes and is now being adapted to contexts outside India.

                Deepalaya’s focus and sole reason for existence is the child,

                family of the child is the medium through which the development
                takes place. Organisation and sensitisation of the community is
                the approach through which empowerment, capacity building and
                social transformation are attempted. We at Deepalaya commit
                ourselves –To identify and work along the economically and
                socially deprived, the physically and mentally challenged –
                starting with children, so that they become educated, skilled
                and aware. Enable them to be self-reliant and enjoy a healthy,
